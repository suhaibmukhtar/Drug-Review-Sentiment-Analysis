# Drug Review Sentiment Analysis Using Various Deep Learning Architectures
## Project Overview
The Drug Review Sentiment Analysis project focuses on employing various deep learning architectures to analyze sentiments expressed in drug reviews. This research-oriented project aims to provide insights that are invaluable in the corporate setting, particularly during phases of Agile methodologies in product development. By automating the sentiment analysis process, corporations can efficiently gather and process feedback about their products, enabling data-driven decision-making and proactive issue resolution.

## Key Features
Utilization of LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM+GRU, and BERT deep learning models for sentiment analysis.
Comparative analysis of model performance to determine the most effective architecture.
Handling of imbalanced datasets through oversampling techniques.
Integration of word embedding techniques such as FastText to preserve sentence context.
Implementation of data preprocessing steps including HTML tag removal, URL removal, punctuation removal, stop word removal, chat word treatment, spelling correction, tokenization, stemming, and lemmatization.
## Datasets
Two datasets were utilized, sourced from Kaggle and the UCI ML repository, containing 162,000 and 360,000 rows respectively. Each dataset includes reviews and corresponding customer satisfaction levels categorized as positive, neutral, or negative.
# Data Acquisition:
Data collected from Kaggle and UCI ML repository.
# Data Preprocessing:
Removal of unwanted information using various techniques.
Handling imbalanced datasets through oversampling.
Conversion of text into numeric form using word embedding techniques.
# Model Selection:
Choose from LSTM, Bi-LSTM, LSTM+GRU, and BERT architectures based on the context preservation requirement.
Model Training and Evaluation:
Train models on the prepared datasets.
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics.
# Objectives
